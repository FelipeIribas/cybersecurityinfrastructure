## Applicable security model to minimize risks.

1    __Security perimeter:__ This is the first line of defense against potential cyber attacks. It includes a combination of security hardware and software, such as firewalls, packet filters, intrusion prevention (IPS) and detection (IDS) systems, and malware prevention systems. All of these devices are configured to protect the company's network from any malicious traffic.

2    __Secure servers:__ These are the critical components of the network that store and process the company's data. They are protected by access controls, encryption, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.

3    __Backup and recovery:__ In case of a security breach or system failure, it is important to have a reliable backup and recovery system in place. This includes regular backups of data, redundant systems, and disaster recovery plans to minimize downtime and data loss.

4    __Network segmentation:__ To further enhance security, the network can be divided into smaller segments, each with its own security controls and access rules. This can limit the damage that a potential attacker can do by isolating compromised systems and preventing lateral movement within the network.

5    __Honeypot:__ An additional layer of security that can be added to the physical infrastructure is a honeypot. This is a system designed to attract attackers and deceive them into thinking they have gained access to important data or systems. The honeypot can be placed behind the existing layers of security so that attackers must pass through the existing layers of security before encountering the honeypot. At the same time, the honeypot should be isolated from the main corporate network so that it has no connection to the company's critical systems.

This is a _basic_ physical cybersecurity structure that can be customized according to the specific needs of your company. It is important to note that the implementation of cybersecurity measures must be constant and constantly evolving to face the increasingly sophisticated threats that exist in the digital world.

### Other __security__ measures (not less important) but not as basic that we can implement are the following:

6    __Employee training__: It is important to educate employees on cybersecurity best practices and policies, as they can be the weakest link in the network's security. Regular training sessions can help raise awareness of potential risks and how to avoid them.

7    __Multifactor authentication__: This adds an additional layer of security to the access control process by requiring users to provide two or more forms of authentication, such as a password and a biometric factor (e.g. fingerprint or facial recognition).

8    __Penetration testing__: This is a simulated cyber attack on the network to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by real attackers. Regular penetration testing can help to continuously improve the network's security.

9    __Security information and event management (SIEM)__: This is a tool that collects and analyzes security-related data from various sources in real-time to identify potential security incidents. SIEM can help detect and respond to threats more effectively and efficiently.

10    __Continuous monitoring__: Cybersecurity measures should be monitored and updated regularly to ensure they are effective and up-to-date. Continuous monitoring can help identify and respond to potential threats before they cause significant damage.

These are just a few additional measures that can be added to enhance the cybersecurity structure. It is important to assess the specific needs and risks of your company and continuously adapt and improve the cybersecurity measures accordingly.
