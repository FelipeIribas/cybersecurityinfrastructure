Applicable security model to minimize risks.

1    Security perimeter: This is the first line of defense against potential cyber attacks. It includes a combination of security hardware and software, such as firewalls, packet filters, intrusion prevention (IPS) and detection (IDS) systems, and malware prevention systems. All of these devices are configured to protect the company's network from any malicious traffic.
2    Secure servers: These are the critical components of the network that store and process the company's data. They are protected by access controls, encryption, and other security measures to prevent unauthorized access or data breaches.
3    Backup and recovery: In case of a security breach or system failure, it is important to have a reliable backup and recovery system in place. This includes regular backups of data, redundant systems, and disaster recovery plans to minimize downtime and data loss.
4    Network segmentation: To further enhance security, the network can be divided into smaller segments, each with its own security controls and access rules. This can limit the damage that a potential attacker can do by isolating compromised systems and preventing lateral movement within the network.
5    Honeypot: An additional layer of security that can be added to the physical infrastructure is a honeypot. This is a system designed to attract attackers and deceive them into thinking they have gained access to important data or systems. The honeypot can be placed behind the existing layers of security so that attackers must pass through the existing layers of security before encountering the honeypot. At the same time, the honeypot should be isolated from the main corporate network so that it has no connection to the company's critical systems.

This is a basic physical cybersecurity structure that can be customized according to the specific needs of your company. It is important to note that the implementation of cybersecurity measures must be constant and constantly evolving to face the increasingly sophisticated threats that exist in the digital world.
